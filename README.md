# Project1-wine-quality-prediction

#This is a data science project using R with the main objective to use machine learning to predict wine quality based on 11 predecessor variables

#there are two datasets in this project:

#winequality-red with 1599 instances and 12 variables

#winequality-white with 4898 instances and 12 variables

# variables:
# Input variables :
#1 - fixed acidity
#2 - volatile acidity
#3 - citric acid
#4 - residual sugar
#5 - chlorides
#6 - free sulfur dioxide
#7 - total sulfur dioxide
#8 - density
#9 - pH
#10 - sulphates
#11 - alcohol
#Output variable (based on sensory data): 
#12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

 
 #The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
